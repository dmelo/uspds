Most of USPDroidsSimulator was developed by Diogo Oliveira de Melo, with a lot of contributions from others. To report bugs or questions about this project, please send an email to dmelo87@gmail.com.

Before compile the simulator, checkout the bin folder. Maybe the compiled binaries are usefull and you will need not to compile the simulador again.

You can easily run the simulator through fast_exec.sh. Only you need to do is execute the command "sh fast_exec.sh".

Some information file (AUTHORS, KNOWN_BUGS...) are deprecated. I'm working hard but my efforts are limited.
